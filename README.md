## Level Reset Macro

This macro allows one to reset Red Ball to the start of a level.
It was built using [**AutoHotkey**](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Upon activating the macro, you will be prompted for:

* **Level** - which level to reset to
* **Hotkey** - which key to bind
* **Turbo** - mouse movements are instant

See the AutoKey documentation for a full [key list](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm).
Hotkey modifier [symbols](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm#Symbols) can also be used.

The "Show All" option should be activated in Adobe Flash Player if the game is running in full screen or the window has been resized.
